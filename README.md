These are specifically projects outside of internship and course work! Most of my work is in my internships! I'm currently a product design intern at Tructric, and I was previously a data science discovery researcher at Catalyst Energy Advisors and an AI/ML Intern at Carviz. At UC Berkeley, I've taken CS61B and CS61A, and I am about to take CS70 and DATA 100. Below is a description of some of the projects I've added


1.) Tab Opener is a Computer Vision Project, that opens specific tabs based off hand movements
2.) I also did research with the Data Science Discovery program. I built a prediction tool to analyze credit risk management challenges in the Paygo Solar Business Model 
3.) I created linear and logistic Regression algorithms from scratch. For the logistic regression algorithm, I trained my algo on a breast cancer research dataset
4.) I have a project from my CIVENG C88 (Data Science for Smart Cities Class), where I basically analyzed schools in Chicago using different algorithms. 
5.) I've also just included some screenshots of different languages I've coded in. I also have quite a bit of experience in Unity.
