Tab Opener is a Computer Vision Project, that opens specific tabs based off hand movements

I created linear and logistic Regression algorithms from scratch. For the logistic regression algorithm, I trained my algo on a breast cancer research dataset

I also did research with the Data Science Discovery program. I built a prediction tool to analyze credit risk management challenges in the Paygo Solar Business Model 

I have a project from my CIVENG C88 (Data Science for Smart Cities Class), where I basically analyzed schools in Chicago using different algorithms.
